I've finally set up the Hugo blog subsite on my personal github site, so here is the obligatory "Hello, world!"

Current thoughts about Hugo:
Neat, but probably would have been better served by a more established/feature-rich system like Jekyll or perhaps Gatsby! 

In particular: I have concerns about dating/naming of posts, especially as this list grows (hopefully) long!
