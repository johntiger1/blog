As a follow-up to my [recent interview-recap on G-Research](../g-research-data-intelligence), I've come to some realizations on some general tips for doing well on technical interviews:

1. Don't procrastinate! 

Scheduling a coding challenge might feel like scheduling a dentist appointment: why are you willingly scheduling pain for yourself?! But like scheduling a dentist appointment, it is a necessary fact of life. Schedule it soon as you have a relatively free day (I know, I know everyone is always busy!). This means that you do have *some* flexibility when it comes to procrastinating: do NOT schedule it on a day where you will be tired, or have another big mental test that day! For instance: do not schedule the interview the same day as you have an assignment due, or another coding challenge!

As a regret minimizer: there have been plenty of times where I have lost out on a job simply because I let the coding challenge/interview expire! As the saying goes, "if you have a free lottery ticket, play it!"

2. Practice

As a counter-point to #1, definitely make sure you practice, and are well-prepared for the challenge! 

3. Food (and drink)!
I personally find it hard to solve coding challenges on an empty stomach. So I make sure to eat (but not too much!) before any coding test! A little bit of coffee also helps.

4. More to come!
