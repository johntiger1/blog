What exactly is the value prop of this blog? Well I like to think that I 
have some interesting things going on in my life:

1. Machine learning, deep learning, linear algebra, statistics. I am a student in deep learning, and am lucky enough to be exposed daily to the inspirational and amazing work being conducted in the U of T ML group, at Vector Institute. In particular, I want to talk about the awesome papers and concepts I learn about in CSC2547 and CSC2541
2. My research: to appear in ACL 2020 (fingers crossed!)
3. Job interviewing experience: I am currently interviewing for a bunch of big N companies, which is something I had absolutely no experience with until recently. It is very much a learning experience for me, so I hope to provide a fresh perspective on the entire process. As a 6th year student (4 years of undergrad, 1 year of co-op and now doing my grad degree) but 1st time acolyte of leetcode, it has been quite a journey! Adding on top of that is that I am applying to data science and machine learning positions, and it is quite a diverse perspective on the entire process!
4. Life experience: I am still growing my wings as a social butterfly, so expect to see a lot of posts reflecting on my social experience!
