There are some new topics and muses for my study:

1. Reinforcement learning (off-policy, on-policy)
2. Embeddings; just generally getting accustomed to the lingo! 
   1. ex. a "question" embedding, or some other use of the word "embedding"
3. Graph neural networks
4. Really want to concretize MCTS + Neural networks; i.e. the Alpha Zero *framework*
