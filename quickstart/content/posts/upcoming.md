So without further ado, here are the posts I plan to make:

1. Exotic python data structures and where to find them (heapq, OrderedDict, Deque, bisect)
2. Onsite interview with Microsoft
3. Reparameterization tricks: Gaussian vs gumbel
4. The REINFORCE gradient estimator
5. Probability notations
6. Research itinerary
7. Birthday post
8. ABD, L1, and Deep learning Symposium follow-up
9. Scale AI follow-up
10. The supremum IS big-O notation  (usually we want the TIGHTEST worst case bound)
11. Model vs Data Parallelism
12. [Some more reinforcement learning][1]
13. [Some more reinforcement learning][^abc]

(Note that the markdown in preview does not exactly work with some more exotic features, like citations and references)

See you soon!

Nice link aggregation:
